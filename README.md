# ACES blender colour management
 OCIO config with standard sRGB, XYZ, Filmic and ACES colour management options.

# How to install.

Copy the folders and OCIO config file into ../blender/version_number/datafiles/colormanagement/ and replace everything.

# How to use.

Pick "Utility - sRGB - Texture" for any colour textures; and "Non-Color" for normal maps, since this works best in Blender specifically.
